Graphical interface via zenity
- skip pretend & use ask ?
- 'sleep' cmd uses most resources ?
- test errors in zenity : checking tmp zenity file existence fails as if emerge fails, zenity doesn't stop (retry pgrep emerge ?)
- use genlop to better estimate emerge percentages
- get colored/bold output from emerge to zenity

Check system used and use the correct way to upgrade system (portage, apt, rpm, pacman...)
